# CyberTyper
A little game that runs in the Windows console, written in C#.

### About
This is one of my first projects in C# where I just expiremented with the language, Nothing special. I decided to make a Github repository for it because I wanted to archive all the previous versions of the game and implement an update system that will require me to host a file on the internet.

The game's concept is based on the websites hackertyper.com and geektyper.com, where you press random keys on your keyboard and it types for you automatically (this probably sounds wierd if you don't know those websites).


### The files in this repository
Most files here will be text files containing a C# class with the CyberTyper code. To run the game, copy and paste the class into your C# file and call the CyberTyper.mainloop() method from your Main.
